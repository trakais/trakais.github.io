=================

A Leaflet based map of nature trails in Latvia. The site can be found on http://dodies.lv, but since it's running on GitHub pages, the routing doesn't work (no PHP support). If you move it to a PHP supporting server, this will work though. 

Data comes from a CSV file, the Tiles used are Skobbler, but my API key is tied to this domain, so you will have to get your own (it's free). 

The head javascript was minified, sorry about that. I will try to find the original at some point.
